# Handwritten_Equations_to_LaTeX
The end result of this project was an app in Streamlit that takes an image of a handwritten equation, and after prompting the user to follow certain instructions, generates the associated LaTeX syntax for the handwritten equation. This project dealt with custom multi class classification using YOLOv4 in Google Colab. There were 74 classes, with each one being a mathematical expression ('x', 'lim', '2', etc.) that are the most commonly found in handwritten Calculus limit equations.
